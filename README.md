# Train Station Ticketing System using PHP/MySQL
<h4>About</h4>
<p>This is a brief explanation of the Train Station Ticketing System which employs PHP/MySQLi to facilitate ticket generation for a railway or train company. The system serves two categories of users: railway or train company management, and ticketing booth staff. It generates a daily report that details all transactions involving the transportation company and its passengers. The management can regulate destination rates from a particular station, and the system will automatically retrieve the corresponding fare once the staff has identified the passenger's desired destination. Moreover, the staff can issue multiple tickets for a single trip, and the system administrator can manage all data in the simple train station ticketing system. Meanwhile, the staff's primary responsibility is to create train tickets for passengers.</p>
